-   I have stopped active development on this site, if you encounter a bug please describe it in the issues section of the repo

-   I have found myself frequently last minute listening to the discover weekly playlist on spotify, wishing for a way to be able to save it easily, this is my solution

## Running

-   Although it is not required, I recommend you install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to install packages for this project if you have a npm installation working then run

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

-   To install the packages for the project run

```bash
pnpm i
```

-   Then to start the dev server

```bash
pnpm dev
```
